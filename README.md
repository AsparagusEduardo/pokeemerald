# About this branch
This branch is a decapitalized (all-caps text replaced with proper capitalization) version of [**Lunos**](https://github.com/LOuroboros)'s `pokeesmeralda` branch.

It's a combination of both his branch and my current decap branch (originally made by [**Wyrserth**](https://github.com/Wyrserth)).

## Bugs

- The big button in the middle of the PokéNav's sprite on the left side of the screen is not being animated, even though it should. 

As the disassembly and translation continues to develop, I'll try to keep up this branch as updated as possible.

It builds the following ROM:

* pokeemerald.gba `sha1: 8C19F2555E10DFF32A9914CEAC360B018AF42E6C`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
