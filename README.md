# Pokémon Infused Emerald

Based on the [pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) disassembly project and inspired by Pokémon Theta Emerald, this project's objective is to improve Pokémon Emerald's experience with features from later generations, including quality of life additions, mechanics and content.

## Current Features:
#### Mechanic Features
* Gen 7 battle mechanics with some of Gen 8's thanks to [DizzyEgg](https://github.com/dizzyeggg)'s [Battle Engine v2](https://github.com/dizzyeggg/pokeemerald/tree/battle_engine_v2).
	* Physical/Special split.
	* Fairy Type.
* New Pokémon up to Gen 7 thanks to [DizzyEgg](https://github.com/dizzyeggg)'s [Pokémon Expansion](https://github.com/dizzyeggg/pokeemerald/tree/pokemon_expansion).
* Many new items thanks to [DizzyEgg](https://github.com/dizzyeggg)'s [Item Expansion](https://github.com/DizzyEggg/pokeemerald/tree/item_expansion).
	* [Strange Souvenir](https://github.com/AsparagusEduardo/pokeemerald/tree/AlolanEvolution), which allows Alola-only evolutions. Code and sprite size-adjusted by me.
* Gen 6 Exp Share. Original code by Blurose, ported by [Lunos](https://github.com/LOuroboros).
* [Soaring](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=422107). Code by camthesaxman, ported by paccy.
#### Quality of Life
* Running Shoes everywhere and from the beginning. Changed dialog to reflect this.
* Reusable TMs.
* [BW2 Repels](https://github.com/DizzyEggg/pokeemerald/tree/repel) functionality.  Code by [DizzyEgg](https://github.com/dizzyeggg).
* [More bag pockets](https://github.com/AsparagusEduardo/pokeemerald/tree/BetterBag) by me.
* Trade Item Evolutions now also have the option to use the item like an evolution stone.
	* A new item, the Link Cable, can be used for trade evolutions without items. Sprite by [KryptonLion](https://www.deviantart.com/kryptonlion).
*  When blacking out, you no longer lose half your money, instead using the [current formula](https://github.com/AsparagusEduardo/pokeemerald/tree/WhiteOutMoney). Code by me, with help from [lightgod87](https://github.com/lightgod87).
* Shows [Type effectiveness in-battle](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?p=10167016#post10167016). Code by PokemonCrazy.
* Eggs hatch at level 1.
* Berry trees don't wither if their berries aren't picked up.
* Easier way of getting to Mirage Island. Hint: Lavaridge Town.

#### Aesthetic
